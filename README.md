# Old Projects Repo
This is a repo to display my projects (including some data science projects and software projects) before summer 2020.

There are:
1. Machine Learning project is about Tesla Price Prediction, using Random Forest and k-Nearest neighbors algorithm in Python.
2. Explortary Data Analysis project is a comprehensive report that summarizes the important features of human resource dataset and makes some recommendations based on the analysis. It is accomplished in R.
3. Bayesian Model project is a course work from STA365, which asked us to fit both bayesian multilevel regression model and bayesian logistics regression model as well as examined the model by plotting prior and posterior distribution by R stan.
4. Software Engineer project is a course work from CSC207. We wrote a flappy-bird game by Java in Android Studio, and implemented object-oriented programming principle. To achieve the game mechanics, we also implemented different design patterns, such as iterator or observer design pattern.

Feel free to go through these works!
